# AIRobot: From FTC Chassis to Self-Driving Vehicle

Inspired by a discarded FTC chassis and a growing interest in autonomous 
vehicles, AIRobot is a project born out of the desire to repurpose existing 
resources.

Initially, I explored potential project ideas on Reddit, hoping to find 
inspiration for my unused FTC chassis. However, the FTC code being partially 
close-sourced and designed exclusively for Android phones became apparent, 
hindering my ability to explore alternative applications. Undeterred by these 
constraints, I decided to embark on a new path.

To unlock the full potential of the chassis, I undertook the task of porting 
the FTC code to the Raspberry Pi platform. This pivotal step expanded the 
project's horizons, enabling the integration of a camera and the development 
of a self-driving model. Through rigorous training and testing, the model 
learned to navigate its environment autonomously.

While challenges arose during the development process, including the need to 
overcome the power limitations of Android phones and optimize model performance 
on the Raspberry Pi architecture, the end result is a testament to the power of 
perseverance and innovation. AIRobot stands as a proof of concept, demonstrating 
the feasibility of transforming a seemingly obsolete component into a cutting-edge 
autonomous vehicle.

This project serves as a valuable resource for those seeking to explore similar 
endeavors, showcasing the potential of repurposing existing robotics components 
to create groundbreaking projects.
